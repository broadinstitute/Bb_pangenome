# TODO - Scaffolding

- [x] add main scripts and notebooks to repo.
- [ ] update paths to reflect repo structure. (need to do the bottom 3 first)
- [ ] re-org data for SRAs
- [ ] re-org data for LRAs, this fits into redundancy elimination more broadly.
- [ ] optimize intermediate files (current size is ~14gb and I'd like to keep from ballooning the repo any further if I can help it.
