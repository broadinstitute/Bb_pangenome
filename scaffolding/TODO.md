# TODO - Scaffolding

- [x] add main scripts and notebooks to repo.
- [x] update paths to reflect repo structure. (need to do the bottom 3 first)
- [x] re-org data for SRAs (isn't duplicated. just tar where possible)
- [x] re-org data for LRAs (was only plasmid calls relevant to scaffolding)
- [x] optimize intermediate files (got it down to ~8GB)
